Everywhere was suffocatingly red.
It was red, but not red red. It was a yellowy red, so vermilion.
The leaves, the trunks, and the branches of the trees in this forest,
though there was some variance in strength, were all the same color.
To say a bit more, the ground onto which the leaves had fallen was
red, too.
No, not red, vermilion. It kind of made his eyes hurt.
Up ahead, Alice C turned back, the sinister shovel thrust into the
ground. “This is the Scarlet Forest.”
It was dirty, or rather stained, but Haruhiro wondered if maybe
Alice’s raincoat had been red at one point.
“Scarlet...” Haruhiro murmured to himself. The word sounded
familiar. If he recalled, Alice had offhandedly mentioned they were
heading to some place with a name like that once. “‘Scarlet’ is the
name of a color, right?”
“What else did you think it was?”
“No, nothing really...”
He hadn’t heard Alice properly to begin with, and there would have
been no point in going, “Scar... what? Sorry, what’d you say?” He’d
just have been ignored. And if he argued back now, saying there
hadn’t really been any reason for him to think it was that color, that
would get ignored, too.

“First you write the beast radical with the character for star beside
it,” Alice explained very quickly, using the tip of the shovel to write
猩 on the ground. “You have two of those next to each other. Then
this character for red,” Alice continued, writing another 猩 beside
the first, and then 緋.
“Ohhhh!”
Alice’s face was mostly hidden by the raincoat’s hood and the mask.
Surprisingly, though, the eyes said as much as the mouth. Those
upturned eyes weren’t simply exasperated; Alice was almost
certainly looking down on Haruhiro.
“The Scarlet Forest, huh,” Haruhiro said. “Okay. The Scarlet Forest...”
He looked down, nodded to himself, cleared his throat, and
scratched his head, but Haruhiro wasn’t feeling out of it.
Or so he thought. Probably.
“Huh?” Haruhiro looked around the area. It was weird. Where’s...?
He couldn’t see Alice anywhere. Why?
“Huh? Whoa, um, Alice?”
There was no response, so he perked his ears up. There was a
rustling of grass, and a faint crunching of leaves underfoot. Or at
least he thought he heard that. It might have just been his
imagination.
No way. Had he been left behind?
He started to run, and nearly ran into something red.
“Wah!”
When he took another look, it was the leaves of a shrub. Everything
here was red—no, scarlet—so it was hard to tell it all apart, but there
was undergrowth all over the place in this forest.
